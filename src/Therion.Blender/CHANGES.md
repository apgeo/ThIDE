# Therion.Blender — changes for consumers

## 2026-11 — correctness and safety fixes

### Behaviour changes
- **`RenderAsync` honours `spec.Output.OutputDirectory`.** When it is set, outputs are written there
  instead of under `jobRoot/job-*`, and the temporary inputs (`model.ply`, `scene-meta.json`,
  `render.py`) are deleted from the job folder afterwards. Migration: read outputs from
  `RenderResult.OutputPaths` (or the directory you set); leave `OutputDirectory` empty for the old
  placement.
